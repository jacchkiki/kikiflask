Linux
If Chromium has been installed from the snap store (the default in the Ubuntu Software Store) it will not be able to access WebUSB devices.

On some Linux distributions eg. Ubuntu,  you may need to declare a udev rule. To do this:
Close Chrome
Create a file at
/etc/udev/rules.d/50-microbit.rules
 with the following content:

Add your user to the plugdev group (replace with your username): 
sudo adduser your_username plugdev 
Restart the udev rules 
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules 
Open Chrome and try to pair again
